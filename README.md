# INFO-Q
Where all the code for INFO-Q, r√©seaux de tenseur goes


For now: a simple NN to test if TN ares better at approximating polynomials.
Instruction for NN
In generate.py choose the wanted degree and the number of different polynomials you want
run it once and then comment the createdf
In nn.py, chose the correct file, it should be generate in the same folder, and run it.
